### Data Structures and Algorithms with C++ 
#### Final Project - Sorting Algorithm Comparison

For this project, I was assigned to make a program to compare the efficiency of the different sorting algorithms we learned throughout class. The algorithms we compared are: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.  

  

This was performed by generating a set of ten randomized test cases of 2000 values each. Each test case was run on each algorithm five times and their times were averaged. Once completed, the program would print out the each test time for each algorithm in a table, and then the Max, Min, and Average for each test number. The test numbers correspond to the different algorithms in the same order as introduced above.
