# DotJumper Project

For my final project in an assembly coding class focused on PIC micro-controllers, I decided to create a game called Dot Jumper using an 8x8 dot matrix. Drawing inspiration from popular games like Log Jumpers and [Crossy Road](https://www.crossyroad.com/), Dot Jumper challenges players to navigate through a maze of obstacles without touching them. In this simplified version, players must avoid colliding with lit LEDs that represent logs and skillfully weave their way to the other side. Your position in the game is indicated by a single LED, and if you come into contact with a log, the level resets.
